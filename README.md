## Setup/Installation Requirements

**DATABASE**
- Install and configure MySQL using these [instructions](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql).
- Install [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) on your computer if it isn't already.


**REPOSITORY**
- Clone this repository.
- Within the production directory "Factory", create a new file called appsettings.json.
- Within appsettings.json, put in the following code, replacing the database name with your database naming convention, uid and pwd values with your own username and password for MySQL. 

>{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[database_name];uid=[id_here];pwd=[your_password];"
  }
}

- Once appsettings.json is complete and you have created your models with all object variables that you want in your database completed, run `dotnet ef migrations add Initial`. Then `dotnet ef database update` to complete migration to your database.
- Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
- Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).
